            Migration has been a fundamental aspect of human history, driven by various factors including economic opportunities, family reunification, political instability, environmental changes, and conflicts. In recent years, however, the scale and complexity of migration have intensified due to a confluence of global events such as armed conflicts, climate change impacts, economic disparities, and political unrest. According to the United Nations, the number of international migrants worldwide reached an estimated 281 million in 2020, reflecting a significant increase over the past decade.
Understanding the dynamics and patterns of human migration is crucial for policymakers, humanitarian organizations, researchers, and the general public. Policymakers need insights into migration trends to develop effective migration policies and strategies. Humanitarian organizations require data to provide assistance and protection to displaced populations. Researchers aim to analyze migration patterns to identify underlying causes and potential solutions. Moreover, the general public's perceptions and attitudes towards migration play a significant role in shaping policies and societal responses to migrants.
Given the multifaceted nature of migration, there is a growing need for comprehensive visualizations that can provide insights into the various dimensions of this complex phenomenon. This project aims to address this need by designing and building a visualization tool that elucidates the context and patterns of human migration, focusing on recent events and trends.
